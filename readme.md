# Notes:

Install the following packages: `scikit-learn` and `pandas`.
It's recommended to use Anaconda to save the hassle of installing these packages.
If you want to use `pip`, you can do: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

rf_model.py will read the training data, fit the model, score the test model and
save the result as `rf-prediction.csv`. The script is written in Python 2.

To run rf_model.py: `python rf_model.py`.
